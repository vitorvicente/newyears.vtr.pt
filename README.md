# newyears.vtr.pt

This website was made at the start of the new year, and serves as a landing page that details my objective for the year, it's one of the many pages I currently run under the vtr.pt domain, all of which are listed bellow.

This website is made up of a single HTML & CSS page using bootstrap, and was developed as a part of an 100 day coding challenge for web development.
